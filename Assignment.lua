  WarbandMeDowns/Assignment.lua
  The global warband assignment engine.

  Instead of answering "is this hovered item an upgrade?" from scratch on
  every tooltip, this precomputes, per warband character and per equipment
  slot, which item they should end up with - considering every equipped,
  bagged, banked, and mailed item across the whole warband at once, so a
  spare in one character's bag can cascade down to a lower-priority
  character instead of being invisible to the recommendation. See
  WarbandMeDowns.lua for the license header covering the whole addon.

  Every item instance in the warband falls into exactly one bucket, decided
  once per recompute in ScanWarband:
    1. Equipped (any bind type) - always a floor a candidate must beat for
       that character/slot. Never reassigned to anyone else.
    2. Bag/bank/mail, NOT sendable to a twink (soulbound, actually already
       Soulbound despite a sendable-looking bind type, or below Uncommon
       quality) - also a floor, but can never be claimed by another
       character.
    3. Bag/bank/mail, sendable to a twink - the only items ever reassigned;
       up for grabs by any eligible character in the warband, including
       their current owner.

  A bind type like "Bind on Equip" or "Warbound until equipped" only
  describes what an item *will* do, not whether a specific instance has
  already bound - see Data.IsActuallySoulbound for how that's resolved.

  The expensive part (the full warband scan) happens once per recompute.
  Settling any one (slot-class, target equip location) pair is lazy and
  memoized for the current generation, so hovering many items that all
  share a slot-class (e.g. browsing a vendor's rings) only ever pays for
  that settlement once.

  *** The answer must not depend on who is logged in ***

  The engine reads stored, account-wide DataStore snapshots, so the same
  item must produce the same recommendation from every character. Three
  things used to break that invariant, and the design below exists to keep
  them fixed:

    - Unreadable items are a distinct state, never a zero. C_Item.GetItemInfo
      and C_Item.GetDetailedItemLevelInfo both return nil for an item the
      client has not cached, which is routine for an alt's stored gear right
      after login. Scoring that as "item level 0" made the alt look like they
      had an empty slot and hand them the item - and since cache warmth
      differs every session, the winner moved around. Anything unreadable now
      yields Assignment.Pending and no tooltip line until the data arrives.

    - Comparisons are transitive. A single *basis* (Pawn score, or item level)
      is chosen once per character per settlement and used for every
      comparison in it, instead of falling back per pair. Mixing two orderings
      in one chain made the greedy winner depend on scan order.

    - Iteration is deterministic. Characters are walked in priority order and
      every candidate bucket is sorted on a stable key, so Lua's `pairs`
      ordering over DataStore's container tables can never leak into the
      result. Priority order itself is a total order down to the character
      key, since table.sort is not stable and would otherwise let the input
      order decide between equally-ranked characters.

  Note Recompute() runs the scan *before* it computes the priority order, not
  after: the order ranks characters on what they own, which only exists once
  the scan has run. See the comment there for why scanning under a provisional
  order is safe.

--
