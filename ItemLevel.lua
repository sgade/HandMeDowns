  WarbandMeDowns/ItemLevel.lua
  Projected average item levels: where a character would land if they equipped
  everything they already carry ("max"), and where they would land once the
  assignment engine also sent them what it earmarked for them ("theoretical").
  Purely presentational - nothing here feeds a recommendation. See
  WarbandMeDowns.lua for the license header covering the whole addon.

  *** Why these are deltas on top of DataStore's average, not averages ***

  The obvious implementation - add up the sixteen slots and divide - would put
  a second, independently-derived number right next to DataStore's, and any
  disagreement between them reads as a bug. DataStore's GetAverageItemLevel is
  whatever Blizzard's own GetAverageItemLevel() said at the last scan, and
  Blizzard's rules for it are not fully reproducible from the outside (how a
  two-hander with an empty offhand is counted, for one).

  So both numbers are computed as `DataStore's average + gain / 16`, where
  `gain` only ever counts slots an unequipped item actually improves. That
  makes "carries nothing useful" render *exactly* equal to the equipped
  average, and keeps the three columns from ever inverting.

  The divisor and the treatment of empty slots are not guesses: across the 22
  characters in this account's DataStore_Inventory snapshot, every stored
  averageItemLvl is an exact multiple of 1/16, including on characters with
  several empty slots - so sixteen slots, empty ones contributing zero.

  *** One latent hazard in the equipped-slot data ***

  DataStore_Inventory's ScanInventorySlot only stores a full item link when
  IsEnchanted(link) matches; otherwise it stores a bare itemID, and
  C_Item.GetDetailedItemLevelInfo on a bare itemID answers with the item's
  *base* item level, no bonus-ID upgrade track applied. That would understate
  an equipped slot and so overstate the gain against it. In practice it does
  not currently bite: IsEnchanted's pattern does not match the modern link
  format, and all 352 stored equipment slots in this account are full links,
  zero bare itemIDs. It is documented here (and in docs/DATA_SOURCES.md)
  because it is a live code path that a link-format change could reactivate.

  *** Weapon slots are a pair, because Blizzard scores them as one ***

  A two-hander counts *twice* toward the average - once for each weapon slot -
  so a character wielding one has no empty offhand as far as the average is
  concerned. Treating that slot as empty (worth 0, and free for anything in the
  bags to fill) was worth roughly +19 on a character at 295, since it handed
  out an entire extra item's worth of gain.

  That the offhand is not simply zero is forced by the stored data: an
  averageItemLvl of 295.1875 is an exact multiple of 1/16 and not of 1/15, so
  there really are sixteen contributions - and if the offhand were one of them
  at zero, that character's fifteen equipped items would have to average 315
  while their character sheet reads 295. The two-hander supplies the sixteenth.

  So while a two-hander is equipped, the offhand's baseline is the main hand's
  item level, a better two-hander gains against *both* slots, and nothing may
  be dropped into the offhand on its own - putting a shield there really means
  also swapping the main hand, which this model does not attempt. That last
  rule under-counts rather than over-counts, which is the safe direction here.

  One further deliberate approximation: level requirements are ignored
  entirely - that is the whole point of the "max" column.
