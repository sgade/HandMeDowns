-- *** Bootstrap
--
-- This file only creates the addon object. WoW addon files are separate Lua
-- chunks - `local`s never cross files - so anything that needs to be shared
-- lives as a namespaced field on this table instead (WarbandMeDowns.Data,
-- WarbandMeDowns.Characters, WarbandMeDowns.Pawn, WarbandMeDowns.Assignment). See
-- WarbandMeDowns.toc for load order: this file must load first.

WarbandMeDowns = LibStub("AceAddon-3.0"):NewAddon("WarbandMeDowns", "AceConsole-3.0")

-- There is deliberately no WarbandMeDowns.Util here. It used to hold
-- arrayContains and clearTable, which are Blizzard's own `tContains` and
-- `wipe` globals under different names.
